Hello folks... Rent-it website
I have created a website to rent a car which is inspired from a themeforest website theme. And also created three pages including contact,blog & vehicles which is user friendly ,and also you can recieve form inputs to the debugconsole.
Highlights -- Responsive in all screen ratio's.
